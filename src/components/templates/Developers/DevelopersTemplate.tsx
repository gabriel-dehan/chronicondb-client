          - &quot;What about those items?&quot;, you think? &quot;Where will I ever find properly formatted data for those hundreds of items?&quot;

            But <strong>don`&apos;t you worry</strong> lad(y), for we`&apos;ve got you covered here at <strong>ChroniconDBâ„¢</strong>.<br />

            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Clone everything.<br />
            In the <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/tree/main/src/engine">Engine data folder</a>, <code>{filters.patch}/extracts/</code> contains almost all the data in JSON format for the latest version.<br />
            The <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/tree/main/src/types">Types</a> will help you make sense of those json files: for instance <code>items.json</code> has it`&apos;s interface <code>Item</code> in the <code>types/Item.types.ts</code> file.<br />
            The rest of the non-versioned data, is in the Engine data folder: <code>dataMappings.ts</code> is the most useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            ChroniconDB is an <strong>open source</strong> React/Typescript application and everything can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client">Github Repository</a>.<br />
            Rest assured that even if you don`&apos;t know Typescript you should still be able to use the data provided here.<br /><br />
            The main issue on our hands is that <strong>I did the coding</strong>. It has - therefore and inevitably - become <strong>a mess</strong>. Believe me.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            So <strong>let me guide you</strong> through this ungodly jungle:<br />
            If you`&apos;re not interested in the display intricacies (a.k.a the front-end) but want some data and logic,
            everything can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/tree/main/src/engine">Engine</a>, or more specifically in the <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/tree/main/src/engine">Engine data folder</a>.
          </p>
          <div>
            In here you`&apos;ll find the following architecture:

            <pre>
              .<br />
              â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>1.10.6/</strong><br />

              â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ enchants.json<br />
              â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ enchantsPool.json<br />
              â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ enchantsSearchIndex.json<br />

              â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ itemsSearchIndex.json<br />
              â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sets.json<br />

              â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>injected/</strong><br />
              â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gemenchantlist.txt<br />
              â”œâ”€â”€ dataMappings.ts<br />
              â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts<br />
              â””â”€â”€ patches.json<br />
            </pre>
            Let`&apos;s start, shall we?
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>VERSIONS</h2>
            Those folders, aptly named by their respective versions <code>x.y.z/</code>, contain most of the data you`&apos;ll need.<br />
            They are automatically created using the command <code>yarn parse:all x.y.z</code> whenever I see that a new version of Chronicon is out.<br />
            If you can`&apos;t see a folder for the latest version, it probably means that <strong>I`&apos;ve been ran over by a Moose</strong>, an unfortunate accident.<br />
            But don`&apos;t fret, you can still generate everything you need yourself by following <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client#how-to-get-up-to-date-item-and-skills-data">those instructions</a>.<br /><br />

            So we have something that looks like this.
            <pre>
              .<br />
              â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>1.10.4/</strong><br />
              â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>extracts/</strong><br />
              â”‚   â””â”€â”€ <strong>sources/</strong><br />
              â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>1.10.2/</strong><br />
              â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>extracts/</strong><br />
              â”‚   â””â”€â”€ <strong>sources/</strong><br />
              â”œâ”€â”€ ...<br />
              â”‚
            </pre>
            <div>
              There are two folders per version:
              <ul>
                <li><code><strong>sources/</strong></code>, contains all the data extracted from the game itself, mainly CSV (sort of) and locales (translations) files.</li>
                <li>
                  <code><strong>extracts/</strong></code>, is where it gets spicy, as it contains all the data parsed and formatted, both from versioned data, and manually extracted data (sigh.)<br />
                  Everything inside the folder is pretty self explanatory, just don`&apos;t pay attention to the <code>*SearchIndex.json</code> files, they are used internally. But if you need indexes for your own search engine, please feel free to use those.<br />
                  To help make sense of those files, do not hesitate to take a peak at the <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/tree/main/src/types">Types</a>: for instance <code>items.json</code> has it`&apos;s interface <code>Item</code> in the <code>types/Item.types.ts</code> file.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inside the extracts, <code>enchantsPool.ts</code> is pretty much extracted from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835123683" rel="nofollow">this guide</a>, it should help you identify which enchants goes with which type of item.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>DATAMAPS</h2>
            A fancy word for everything I had to map-out by hand (pepega) because it could not be extracted from the game directly.
            I am talking about the following files:

            <pre>
              .<br />
              â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>injected/</strong><br />
              â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gemenchantlist.txt<br />
              â”œâ”€â”€ dataMappings.ts<br />
              â””â”€â”€ patches.json<br />
            </pre>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code><strong>injected/</strong></code>, does not contain much apart from my tears and blood, and a manually extracted list of gem enchants. Those are automatically baked in the versioned <code>enchants.json</code> so you can forget about it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>dataMappings.ts</code> contains most of the data mappings, mainly which item goes in which set, all the sets ids, what item type is in which category, etc...
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>patches.json</code> contains all the patches known to the application. Not very useful to you, I guess.
              </li>
            </ul>
            As said before, to help make sense of this mess, the <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/tree/main/src/types">Types</a> are a breath of fresh air.
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>ENGINE</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/tree/main/src/engine">This</a> is a bit application specific, but could probably be used elsewhere.<br />
            <pre>
              . <br/>
              â”œâ”€â”€ Engine.ts<br/>
              â”œâ”€â”€ EngineEnchants.ts<br/>
              â”œâ”€â”€ EngineItems.ts<br/>
              â”œâ”€â”€ EngineSkills.ts<br/>
              â”œâ”€â”€ context.ts<br/>
              â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>data/</strong><br/>
              â”œâ”€â”€ <strong>parsers/</strong><br/>
              â””â”€â”€ <strong>utils/</strong><br/>
            </pre>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code><strong>data/</strong></code>, you know this one. I just can`&apos;t seem to be able to shut up about it.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the <code><strong>parsers/</strong></code> folder you`&apos;ll find the code that generates the versioned JSON extracts. The code that is called when you do a <code>yarn parse:all VERSION</code>, yup, the one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>Engine.ts</code>, <code>EngineItems.ts</code>, <code>EngineEnchants.ts</code>, <code>EngineSkills.ts</code>, contain a lot of logic code, as well as finders, filters, and helper methods to work with the data.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>TEMPLATING</h2>
            If you look at the enchants and skills, you`&apos;ll notice that their descriptions are looking like that:
            <pre>
              Using a |ShieldÂ¥ skill increases |SwordÂ¥ skill damage by EFFECT% for DURATION seconds, stacking VALUE times. Using a |SwordÂ¥ skill increases |ShieldÂ¥ skill damage by EFFECT% for DURATION seconds, stacking VALUE times.
            </pre>
            This is called a templating string and actual values are usually inserted into it at runtime.
            The templating system in Chronicon is a bit convoluted but if you want to see how it`&apos;s integrated in ChroniconDB, feel free to look at the <code>renderDescription()</code> functions in the following files: <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/blob/main/src/components/organisms/Skills/Skill/Skill.tsx">Skills</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/chronicondb-client/blob/main/src/components/molecules/Items/AppliedEnchant/AppliedEnchant.tsx">Enchants</a>.
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>ASSETS</h2>
            If you`&apos;ve read up to here, I believe you`&apos;ll be able to find them yourselves in the repository.<br />
            Think of it as your homework if you will. Hint: it`&apos;s not in the Engine.
          </div>

          <p>
            Use the data as you like, the same goes for the code. If you want to take out the parsers and use them directly into your own projects, do it.<br />
            <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/about/">Do whatever the fuck you want</a> with all this.<br /><br />
            That`&apos;s all I could think of for now, hope it helped.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
