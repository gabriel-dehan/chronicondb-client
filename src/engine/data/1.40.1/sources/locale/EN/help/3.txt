The following defensive stats will affect indirect damage:
[list]

[/list]
@Mana Shield
There are effects that drain Mana instead of Health when taking damage. These effects are unique in the way that they are triggered by both direct and indirect damage.
Not to be confused with regular barriers/shields, which provide temporary additional health, and is shown as a light blue bar on your healthbar.
@Gibbing
Gibbing is when killed enemies explode into meaty bits, eg gibs. This happens when the killing blow on an enemy hits for more than half their maximum health. Some enchants, passives, and item powers may also cause enemies to gib regardless of damage dealt.
