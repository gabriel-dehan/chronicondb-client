The Mechanist offers new ways to build your character so there are some new things to be aware of, such as mechanic interactions and new stats.
@Ammo Find
The Mechanist has a chance to find Ammo, a unique resource which fuels many abilities, on kills. This stat increases the chance for Ammo to drop.
@+Max Ammo
Increaes the maximum Ammo the Mechanist can hold.
@Parry
This is a defensive stat unique to the Mechanist. It works just like Evasion - giving you a chance to completely avoid damage.
Parry is checked before Evasion, so you can safely utilize both these stats and still reliably use passives or other effects that trigger on successful parries.
@Drones
Drones are a new mechanic, which changes existing Satellites (gained from passive skills, powers, or enchants) into more powerful and thematic Drones.
Drones are not companions, and do not inherit or copy any of the Mechanist's stats - they work just like regular Satellites do + whatever the related skill description reads.
Both "Drone Effect" and "Tech Effect" stats will increase the strength of the Drones - this is directly reflected in their tooltips.
In addition, "Satellite Strength" also affects the Drones (with the exception for Power Bots and Bomb Bots), as the Drones base their damage on the Sateliites they convert from.
Drones deal indirect damage by default.
@Turrets
Turrets are a skill like any other, and do not interact with anything in any special way - they are not companions, don't inherit stats, and attack speed does not make them shoot faster.
They generally work like any regular Sentry skill (stationary skill that attacks/hits repeatedly).
