@Why can't I equip some items?
They may be too high level for you to use or they may be locked to a different class. You will normally get a message explaining why you can't equip an item when you try.
@Why do I find items for other classes?
You only find items of the lower rarities for other classes. High rarity items are always for your own class (Unique and higher), with some exceptions from Quests and monster-specific guaranteed drops. You can lower your chance of getting items for other classes by improving your Magic Find stat.
@What are enchants?
Enchants are special effects that are sometimes applied to dropped items. Enchants can grant you special bonuses or increase stats. These can be improved or replaced in the Chronicon area, when you've completed Chantie's quest.
@Why are some enchants in orange colour text and some in white?
Orange colour enchants are static, meaning they will always roll on this specific item. This means that the item will roll a larger total amount of enchants!
@Why are some special texts in a red colour?
These are Epic Enchants. They are very powerful effects unique to that specific item, so you can't find them from any other item!
@What are sets?
Sets are pieces of equipment that are tied together. By equipping several pieces of a set, you'll unlock the set bonuses.
@What are set bonuses?
Set bonuses are special effects or stats granted by wearing matching parts of a set. These can be basic such as improving a certain element, or very powerful such as removing a cooldown from a skill, drastically improving a skills damage, or changing how a mechanic works entirely.
@What items are part of sets?
Set items first start appearing on the Unique rarity. These can be found from level 10 and up. Legendary class sets can be found from level 30 and up. Though set items are pretty rare!
